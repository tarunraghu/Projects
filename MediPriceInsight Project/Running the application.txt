2. Visit http://localhost:5000 for the main homepage
3. Use the homepage to navigate to different applications
4. Or directly access individual applications at their respective ports

STEP 4: APPLICATION MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------
While the applications are running, you can use these commands in the terminal:
- 'status' - Show current status of all applications
- 'restart' - Restart all applications
- 'stop' - Stop all applications
- 'exit' - Stop all applications and exit
- 'help' - Show available commands

STEP 5: TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------
If you encounter issues:

1. Directory Name Invalid Error:
   - Make sure you're in the correct project directory
   - All paths are now dynamic and should work from any location

2. Port Already in Use:
   - Stop any existing applications first
   - Use 'netstat -ano | findstr :5000' to check if ports are in use

3. Application Not Loading:
   - Check if all applications started successfully
   - Verify the correct ports are being used
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

STEP 6: STOPPING APPLICATIONS
-----------------------------
To stop all applications:
1. In the terminal where you ran start_all_apps.py, type 'stop'
2. Or press Ctrl+C to stop all applications
3. Or type 'exit' to stop and close the terminal

NOTES:
- All applications use dynamic paths and should work from any directory
- The main homepage (port 5000) serves the existing index.html template
- Each application runs independently on its own port
- Make sure all required dependencies are installed before running

For additional help, check the README.md files in each application directory.
